In this project, I conducted data analysis on Zomato restaurant data using Python. I used libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore trends and patterns.

I started by preprocessing the data and then delved into exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing distributions and relationships. I examined restaurant types, online order availability, and ratings distribution.

Additionally, I identified the restaurant(s) with the highest number of votes and explored the relationship between online order availability and ratings. Through pivot tables and heatmaps, I visualized categorical variables' relationships, providing insights into the dataset's structure and patterns.

Overall, this analysis offers valuable insights for restaurant owners, policymakers, and Zomato, guiding strategic decisions to enhance the dining experience.
