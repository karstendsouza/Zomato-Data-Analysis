📊 Zomato Data Analysis 🍽 

🔍 As a data analyst, I've delved into Zomato's dataset to unveil actionable insights crucial for restaurant stakeholders. Here's a snapshot of key findings and solutions derived from the analysis:

1️⃣ Understanding Restaurant Types: Leveraging a count plot, I visualized the distribution of restaurant types listed on Zomato. This insight can guide marketing strategies and investment decisions tailored to specific restaurant categories.

2️⃣ Exploring Customer Preferences: Through a box plot comparing ratings with online ordering availability, I identified how the provision of online ordering impacts customer ratings. This understanding can inform restaurant owners on enhancing their online services to meet customer expectations.

3️⃣ Heatmap Analysis: By visualizing the relationship between restaurant types and online order availability using a heatmap, I provided a comprehensive overview of customer behaviour. This insight can guide operational decisions, such as optimizing online ordering services based on the preferences of different restaurant types.

4️⃣ Cost Considerations: Analyzing the distribution of approximate costs for two people using a histogram, I highlighted pricing trends in the restaurant industry. This information can guide pricing strategies and help restaurants attract customers by offering competitive pricing.

5️⃣ Identifying Popular Restaurants: Through a simple analysis identifying the restaurant(s) with the maximum number of votes, I shed light on customer preferences and popular dining destinations. This insight can guide marketing efforts and partnerships with highly-rated restaurants to enhance brand visibility and customer loyalty.

📈 This data-driven approach empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions, enhance customer experiences, and drive business growth in the competitive restaurant industry.
