In this project, I conducted a comprehensive data analysis of Zomato restaurant data using Python. By leveraging powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I gained valuable insights into various aspects of the dataset.

Initially, I imported the dataset and performed data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values and converting data types. Subsequently, I explored the data through exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, visualizing key trends and distributions using bar plots, histograms, and boxplots.

I examined the distribution of restaurant types, analyzed the availability of online orders, and investigated the distribution of ratings across different restaurant categories. Moreover, I identified the restaurant(s) with the highest number of votes and explored the relationship between online order availability and customer ratings.

By creating pivot tables and heatmaps, I visualized the relationship between different categorical variables, providing a deeper understanding of the dataset's structure and patterns.

Overall, this data analysis project provided valuable insights into the Zomato dataset, shedding light on factors influencing restaurant popularity, customer preferences, and service availability. These insights can inform strategic decisions for restaurant owners, policymakers, and Zomato itself, ultimately enhancing the dining experience for customers and stakeholders alike.
